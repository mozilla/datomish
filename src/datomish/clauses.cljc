;; A CC is a collection of clauses that are combined with JOIN.
;; The topmost form in a query is a ConjoiningClauses.
;;
;; Ordinary pattern clauses turn into FROM parts and WHERE parts using :=.
;; Predicate clauses turn into the same, but with other functions.
;; Function clauses with bindings turn into:
;;   * Subqueries. Perhaps less efficient? Certainly clearer.
;;   * Projection expressions, if only used for output.
;;   * Inline expressions?
;; `not` turns into NOT EXISTS with WHERE clauses inside the subquery to
;; bind it to the outer variables, or adds simple WHERE clauses to the outer
;; clause.
;; `not-join` is similar, but with explicit binding.
;; `or` turns into a collection of UNIONs inside a subquery.
;; `or`'s documentation states that all clauses must include the same vars,
;; but that's an over-simplification: all clauses must refer to the external
;; unification vars.
;; The entire UNION-set is JOINed to any surrounding expressions per the `rule-vars`
;; clause, or the intersection of the vars in the two sides of the JOIN.

;; `from` is a list of [source alias] pairs, suitable for passing to honeysql.
;; `bindings` is a map from var to qualified columns.
;; `wheres` is a list of fragments that can be joined by `:and`.
