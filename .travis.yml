  # We can't pick individual features out with `cargo test --all` (At the time of this writing, this
  # works but does the wrong thing because of a bug in cargo, but its fix will be to disallow doing
  # this all-together, see https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/5364 for more information). To
  # work around this, we run tests individually for subcrates that rely on `rusqlite`.
