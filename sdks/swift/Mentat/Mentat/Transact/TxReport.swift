/**
 This class wraps a raw pointer than points to a Rust `TxReport` object.

 The `TxReport` contains information about a successful Mentat transaction.

 This information includes:
 - `txId` - the identifier for the transaction.
 - `txInstant` - the time that the transaction occured.
 - a map of temporary identifiers provided in the transaction and the `Entid`s that they were mapped to,

 Access an `Entid` for a temporary identifier that was provided in the transaction can be done through `entid(String:)`.

 ```
 let report = mentat.transact("[[:db/add "a" :foo/boolean true]]")
 let aEntid = report.entid(forTempId: "a")
 ```
