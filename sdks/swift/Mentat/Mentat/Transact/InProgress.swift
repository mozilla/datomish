/**
 This class wraps a raw pointer that points to a Rust `InProgress` object.

 `InProgress` allows for multiple transacts to be performed in a single transaction.
 Each transact performed results in a `TxReport` that can be used to gather information
 to be used in subsequent transacts.

 Committing an `InProgress` commits all the transacts that have been performed using
 that `InProgress`.

 Rolling back and `InProgress` rolls back all the transacts that have been performed
 using that `InProgress`.

 ```
 do {
     let inProgress = try mentat.beginTransaction()
     let txReport = try inProgress.transact(transaction: "[[:db/add "a" :foo/long 22]]")
     let aEntid = txReport.entid(forTempId: "a")
     let report = try inProgress.transact(transaction: "[[:db/add "b" :foo/ref \(aEntid)] [:db/add "b" :foo/boolean true]]")
     try inProgress.commit()
 } catch {
    ...
 }
 ```

 `InProgress` also provides a number of functions to generating an builder to assert datoms programatically.
 The two types of builder are `InProgressBuilder` and `EntityBuilder`.

 `InProgressBuilder` takes the current `InProgress` and provides a programmatic interface to add
 and retract values from entities for which there exists an `Entid`. The provided `InProgress`
 is used to perform the transacts.

 ```
 let aEntid = txReport.entid(forTempId: "a")
 let bEntid = txReport.entid(forTempId: "b")
 do {
     let inProgress = try mentat.beginTransaction()
     let builder = try inProgress.builder()
     try builder.add(entid: bEntid, keyword: ":foo/boolean", boolean: true)
     try builder.add(entid: aEntid, keyword: ":foo/instant", date: newDate)
     let (inProgress, report) = try builder.transact()
     try inProgress.transact(transaction: "[[:db/add \(aEntid) :foo/long 22]]")
     try inProgress.commit()
 } catch {
    ...
 }
 ```

`EntityBuilder` takes the current `InProgress` and either an `Entid` or a `tempid` to provide
 a programmatic interface to add and retract values from a specific entity. The provided `InProgress`
 is used to perform the transacts.

 ```
 do {
     let transaction = try mentat.beginTransaction()
     let builder = try transaction.builder(forTempId: "b")
     try builder.add(keyword: ":foo/boolean", boolean: true)
     try builder.add(keyword: ":foo/instant", date: newDate)
     let (inProgress, report) = try builder.transact()
     let bEntid = report.entid(forTempId: "b")
     try inProgress.transact(transaction: "[[:db/add \(bEntid) :foo/long 22]]")
     try inProgress.commit()
 } catch {
    ...
 }
 ```
